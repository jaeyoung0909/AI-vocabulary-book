## User Manual

For first-time users, click the 'Sign Up' button and enter a username and password.
If you have signed up, lick the 'log-in' button and enter your username & password in the appropriate text fields.

On the home page, there is a large box for inputting the text you want the system to analyze. Copy or type some text into
the box, and click one of two buttons.

The "frequency words" button creates a list of low-frequency words from the text inputted. The "selected frequency words"
button produces fifteen low-frequency English words, and will ask you to check the words you do not know. If you participate
in this activity and hit submit, the database will update to reflect the words you do and don't know. This will help
improve the accuracy of the overall system.

On the home page, there is also a "Recommendations" link. This button directs you to a page with a list of the words you
do not know, along with words you likely don't know. The words are currently only displayed in English.

On both the home page and the recommendations page, there is a "Log-out" button to sign out of your account on the system.
