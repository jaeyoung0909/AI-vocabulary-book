# Problems 

1. We did not have sufficient experience for finding a good threshold and did not evaluate our accuracy, so we do not know how well estimated it is.
2. Our frequency checker can not decide whether words found in submitted articles are real words, so frequency words list can contain words which are not real words.
3. If a user's words ability data does overlap ebough with the existing data, our recommendation system does not make good inferences.
4. Numerous problems attempting to implement a translation API; as such, translations are not available.
