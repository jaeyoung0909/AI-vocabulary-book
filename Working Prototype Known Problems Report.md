# Problems 

1. We did not sufficient experience for finding good threshold and did not evaluate our accuracy, so we don not know how well estimated.
2. Our frequency checker can not decide whether the word in articles is a real word, so frequency words list can contain words which is not real words.
3. If user's words ability data is not much overlap with existing data, our recommandation system does not inference well.
