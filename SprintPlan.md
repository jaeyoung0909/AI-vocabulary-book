# Release Plan: AI Vocabulary Quiz          
by team MoondeMoonde
At the end of your team's release planning meeting, the team needs to turn in a release plan. This
document needs to be typewritten (or the team needs to use a web-based agile planning tool and
provide the TA or tutor access to the tool to view the project) and have the following elements:
## Heading: Document name ("Release Plan"), product name, team name, release name,
release date, revision number & revision date.
## High level goals: A description of the top-level goals for the release. Examples include,
for a game: "Be able to play one complete level (but with limitations xx, yy, & zz),"
"Have all controller capabilities implemented," "Be able to create levels using a level
design tool;" or for the Osric system: “Be able to handle service requests for new and
existing customers with access to requests by managers and technicians.” These highlevel goals may map to a single user story, but more typically will map to multiple user
stories. The release functionality that is required by CMPS 115 (prototype testing,
continuous integration, and website) must be listed as high level goals in this section of
the document. High level goals must be listed in priority order, from highest (top) to
lowest (bottom).
## User stories for release: A listing of all the user stories that are needed to implement the
high level goals. Each user story must have a story point time estimate. Each user story must be assigned to a Sprint, and within each Sprint, listed in priority order from highest (top) to lowest (bottom). Recall that there are 3 Sprints in this class. Each high level goal should have one or more user stories associated with it. User stories that do not
correspond to a high level goal, or a high level goal that has no associated user story, are
both indications of a lack of project specification.
Recall that a user story should take the form, "As a {user role}, I want {goal} [so that
{reason}]". A user story should fit on an index card, and meet the "INVEST" criteria
(independent, negotiable, valuable, estimatable, sized appropriately, and testable).
The complete list of user stories will take the form of:
o Sprint 1
(story points) User story 1 (highest priority for Sprint 1)
(story points) User story 2
...
(story points) User story N (lowest priority for Sprint 1, but might get bumped
down into Sprint 2 if not implemented in Sprint 1)
o
o Sprint 2
(story points) User story 1 (highest priority for Sprint 2)
(story points) User story 2
...
(story points) User story N (lowest priority for Sprint 2, but might bump down to
Sprint 3)
o
o Sprint 3
(story points) User story 1 (highest priority for Sprint 3)
(story points) User story 2
...
(story points) User story N (lowest priority for Sprint 3, and would be pushed into
an independent study or another class if not implemented)
## Product backlog: A listing of all high level goals and user stories that were discussed in
the release planning meeting, but which did not make it into the release. This can be used
as a starting point for planning the next release as an independent study. If this section is
empty, there should be an explanation for why this is the case.
## Project presentation: See the template for the initial presentation in the Resources.
